# PDG Particle Code Lookup

A web-based tool for quickly identifying particles from their PDG (Particle Data Group) Monte Carlo numbering codes used in GEANT4 simulations.

## Usage

Simply visit the tool at: **[mattiafani.github.io/pdg-lookup](https://mattiafani.github.io/pdg-lookup)**

Enter a PDG code in the search box:
- Elementary particles: `22` (photon), `2212` (proton), `11` (electron), `-2212` (anti-proton), `-11` (positron)
- Nuclear isotopes: `1000180400` (Argon-40), `1000060120` (Carbon-12)

## What is a PDG Code?

The PDG numbering scheme is a standardized system for particle identification used in Monte Carlo simulations like GEANT4. It assigns unique numerical codes to:
- Elementary particles (quarks, leptons, gauge bosons)
- Composite particles (mesons, baryons)
- Nuclei and ions
- Antimatter particles

## Data Sources

All particle properties and liquid argon interaction data are sourced from:
- Particle Data Group (PDG)
- NIST Physical Reference Data
- GEANT4 Physics Reference Manual
- ICARUS Collaboration publications
- ENDF Nuclear Data Library
